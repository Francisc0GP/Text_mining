Hello,

Thank you for visiting my repository. I am currently new to this project and still on the learning curve. This repository is part of my journey to improve my skills and knowledge in Data science.

While I am continuously working to enhance the code and documentation, please note that there may be areas that need improvement. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated as they will help me learn and grow.

Feel free to explore the code, and if you have any tips or advice, I would love to hear from you. Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

Francisco Javier Gonzalez Perez
